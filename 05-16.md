## 🔍 Topic: Multisig Address Creation & Device Behavior

### ❓ Core Question:
What happens if BTC is sent to a single device’s address instead of the intended multisig wallet?

---

## 🧪 Key Findings

### 📌 Devices Can Serve Dual Purposes
- A single hardware wallet (e.g. Coldcard, Trezor) can:
  - **Independently manage its own Bitcoin addresses and private keys**  
  - **Simultaneously participate in a multisig wallet setup** (e.g. as 1 of 3 signers in a 2-of-3 multisig)

### 🔐 Multisig Address Creation
- A **multisig address** is created by combining **public keys from multiple devices** into a script that defines:
  - The **required number of signatures** (e.g. 2-of-3)
  - The **policy descriptor** that wallets use to track and sign transactions
- Sparrow Wallet and other tools can **construct these addresses** once all cosigners are added

### ⚠️ Sending BTC to a Single Device Address vs Multisig
- **Sending BTC to a device's individual address**:
  - Funds are controlled **only by that device's private key**
  - It is **not protected by the multisig setup**
- **Sending BTC to the multisig address**:
  - Requires **multiple signatures to spend**, as defined by the multisig policy
  - Enhances **security and redundancy**

## 💬 Questions Explored

- **Q: Can a device be part of a multisig wallet and still receive BTC to its own addresses?**  
  ✅ *Yes.* Devices can manage both types of wallets simultaneously—single-sig and multisig.

- **Q: What happens if we mistakenly send BTC to a cosigner’s individual address?**  
  ⚠️ *Only that device will be able to spend those funds.* It bypasses the intended multisig protection.

- **Q: Who creates the multisig address?**  
  🛠️ *Usually done by wallet software like Sparrow*, which takes the public keys of each cosigner and builds the address and descriptor.

## 🧾 Summary

- Devices can play **multiple roles** in Bitcoin management.
- It's essential to **double-check address types** before sending funds.
- Using **proper multisig addresses ensures all signers are required to authorize transactions** as intended.

**Next Steps:** Continue practicing address generation and test transactions to build deeper confidence.
